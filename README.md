# ToDesktop Clone

This project is a UI clone of the ToDesktop website, created purely for learning purposes.

## About the Project
I built this project to practice frontend development and understand modern CSS workflows.  
The focus of this project was not originality of design, but learning and implementation.

## What I Learned
- Tailwind CSS fundamentals
- Mobile-first design approach
- Creating responsive layouts
- Basic JavaScript for UI interactions


## Tech Stack
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript

## Note
This is one of my very first frontend projects.  
I learned a lot while building it, and I plan to create many more projects using different technologies in the future.
